# Medical Data Visualizer

 I have completed a project to develop a medical data visualizer using Python. This project involved analyzing and visualizing medical data to identify trends and patterns.

Key Tasks:

I analyzed a medical dataset using Pandas to extract meaningful insights.
I have created various plots using Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize data distributions and correlations.
I have developed a heatmap to display correlations between different medical variables.

Skills Gained:

Python Programming
Data analysis with Pandas
Data visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn
This project enhanced my skills in data analysis and visualization, allowing me to effectively communicate insights from medical data.
